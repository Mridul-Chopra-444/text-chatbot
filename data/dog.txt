Dogs are very gentle creatures. They are create by God to take care of human beings. 
My dog's name is Pudim. He is very calm in nature and likes to play with his toys. 
He eats dog food everyday and I take him out for walk every day, twice a day. 
He helps me talk to and approach attractive girls around me.
